WEBVTT

00:03.320 --> 00:10.010
Welcome back in this and the subsequent steps you will start setting up a simple service on the currency

00:10.010 --> 00:10.840
exchange.

00:11.000 --> 00:18.510
Service as usual we will go to start dot spring  dot io and pick up maven Project Java and use a version

00:18.510 --> 00:20.920
of spring boot which is greater then 2.0.0 .

00:21.170 --> 00:23.570
As usual do not use snapshots.

00:23.700 --> 00:30.440
The group ID at the same com in 28 minutes micro services the artifact ID I want to use.

00:30.470 --> 00:39.740
Currency exchange service the very cautious about it currency hyphen exchange hyphen service and we would

00:39.740 --> 00:42.010
want to create a web application.

00:42.080 --> 00:48.290
Actually we would want to create a service or a rest service so I will use web that's the one we have use to create a restFUL web.

00:48.290 --> 00:54.260
Services I would want it to be able to automatically pick up changes dev tools.

00:54.350 --> 00:58.410
I would also want to be able to monitor the application actuator.

00:58.500 --> 01:02.080
We would want to connect the application to a spring cloud config server.

01:02.120 --> 01:06.600
So we would need config client so config client.

01:07.210 --> 01:12.330
So those are the four dependencies that you would need.

01:12.330 --> 01:15.070
Important things that you would need to be cautious about our.

01:15.360 --> 01:20.860
version of spring boot at least 2.0.0 and do not use the snapshot.

01:21.030 --> 01:28.680
The other ones are give the proper artifact ID currency hyphen exchange hyphen service and make sure

01:28.710 --> 01:33.670
that you would choose all the four dependencies that are present in here.

01:33.720 --> 01:40.710
The most important one our Web and config client once you have done that you are ready to now generate

01:40.710 --> 01:41.500
a project.

01:41.640 --> 01:45.260
If you click generate project it would download the zip.

01:45.300 --> 01:52.080
Make sure that you unzip the file to a specific folder and we can import the project from Eclipse.

01:52.170 --> 01:58.590
I can import that project into Eclipse base file import existing Maven projects and I would want to

01:58.590 --> 02:04.370
use I would copy the zip file to this specific location.

02:04.400 --> 02:12.360
0 3 Micro services currency exchange service and I would press tab and now we can see currency exchange service being listed

02:12.360 --> 02:13.140
down here.

02:13.140 --> 02:15.970
I can click the finish when the import is complete.

02:15.990 --> 02:19.640
You would see a folder set up similar to what you would see in here.

02:19.810 --> 02:25.590
You would have source main Java source main resources source test Java and mavendependencies where all the dependencies

02:25.590 --> 02:27.570
of this project are listed down.

02:27.960 --> 02:33.510
What I would also want to do is to make sure that the application name for this application is properly

02:33.510 --> 02:35.340
configured.

02:35.340 --> 02:40.620
The application name that I would want the same for this is spring dot application dot.

02:40.640 --> 02:49.140
Name the name which we would want to give it is exactly what we used as the artifact ID currency exchange

02:49.380 --> 02:53.080
service make sure that you get this absolutely right.

02:53.200 --> 02:59.480
Currency hyphen exchange hyphen service the other thing we would want to be really cautious about.

02:59.490 --> 03:02.570
Is the port that we use for the currency exchange service.

03:02.580 --> 03:07.240
As we discussed earlier the ports which we want to use this eight thousand eight thousand one and eight thousand

03:07.290 --> 03:13.360
two so I would set the default port to eight thousand.

03:13.530 --> 03:14.890
How do we set this server port.

03:15.000 --> 03:19.030
So server dot is equal to eight thousand.

03:19.140 --> 03:23.110
When you start this application up you'd see that the application would start up fine.

03:23.160 --> 03:26.470
Would it be have not really exposed any services out of it yet.

03:26.490 --> 03:30.900
The next step will create a simple currency exchange service.

03:31.200 --> 03:32.100
Until then bye bye.
