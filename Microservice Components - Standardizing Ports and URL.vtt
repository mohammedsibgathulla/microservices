00:03.500 --> 00:10.410
Welcome back one of the important things about this Microservice section is that we would be developing

00:10.410 --> 00:12.970
a lot of components.

00:13.230 --> 00:22.200
We would be installing at least seven different projects and therefore it's very important to standardize

00:22.200 --> 00:26.210
the ports on which we would run these applications.

00:26.430 --> 00:33.690
So if you're going to github repository spring micro services and going to the folders 0 3 Microservices

00:33.780 --> 00:37.720
that's where all the code for this section of the Course is present for the micro.

00:37.720 --> 00:45.570
service section of the Course is present and if you scroll further down you'd see a list of ports that we would

00:45.570 --> 00:50.240
be using for each of these components.

00:50.300 --> 00:57.680
So for the limit service we would always be using 8080 and 8081 and so on for the currency exchange service.

00:57.740 --> 00:59.010
It's 8000.

00:59.220 --> 01:05.110
And the next number is currency conversion service would be eight thousand one hundred and so on the

01:05.160 --> 01:10.730
spring cloud config server Netflix Eureka naming server Zuul API Gateway Server.

01:10.860 --> 01:17.720
and zipkin Distributed Tracing Server you'd be using their default ports which for Sping cloud

01:17.730 --> 01:24.860
config server its 8888 naming server its 8761, 8765 and 9411.

01:24.980 --> 01:29.250
This is one thing you need to be focused on when we are creating a component.

01:29.280 --> 01:35.230
Make sure that you're using the right tool you would stress that during the course a lot as well.

01:35.430 --> 01:42.270
This would ensure that there is no confusion about which application or which component you are really making

01:42.270 --> 01:43.470
use of.

01:43.470 --> 01:51.300
The other thing is the URLs because there are so many components that means they are lot of

01:51.300 --> 01:52.950
URLs as well.

01:53.010 --> 01:58.110
Some of the URLs are really large as well so if you look at the currency exchange services the currency

01:58.110 --> 02:03.420
conversion service especially when we are going through zuul these comp URL might get really

02:03.420 --> 02:04.350
complex.

02:04.530 --> 02:10.790
So if you're facing any problems with the URLs then you can come over to this U R L section.

02:10.950 --> 02:16.530
This contains all the URLs that we make use of in this course.

02:16.530 --> 02:22.520
So if you are facing a problem in creating URL for something then you can start from here.

02:22.530 --> 02:28.580
So this is the URL section just below the port section.

02:28.640 --> 02:29.280
That's it.

02:29.300 --> 02:32.420
Those are two things that are important to this course in this video.

02:32.540 --> 02:33.690
until the next video bye bye.
