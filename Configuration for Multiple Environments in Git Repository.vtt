00:03.570 --> 00:10.450
Welcome back the previous step we establish the connection between spring cloud config server and the local

00:10.450 --> 00:19.780
GIT repository we were able to say local host 8 8 8 8 limits service slash default and retrieve the configuration

00:19.780 --> 00:22.980
for that specific service.

00:23.080 --> 00:30.220
Now the other question is we would want to be able to store configuration for multiple environments.

00:30.460 --> 00:35.570
So this limits services might have DEV environment or QA environment and the stage environment I would

00:36.100 --> 00:42.330
want to be able to store the configuration for all those environments inside the.

00:42.380 --> 00:43.700
GIT repository.

00:43.870 --> 00:45.190
How do I do that.

00:45.220 --> 00:48.080
Let's look at that in this specific step.

00:48.140 --> 00:53.640
Earlier we created a simple file right limits hyphen service dot properties.

00:53.670 --> 00:57.260
Now this becomes the default configuration.

00:57.370 --> 01:04.220
So what ever values are present in the limit servies becomes the default configuration for the limit service

01:04.410 --> 01:05.450
however.

01:05.500 --> 01:09.420
You can override them for a specific environment.

01:09.430 --> 01:11.020
How do I override them.

01:11.230 --> 01:13.330
I can make a copy of this file I would.

01:13.470 --> 01:19.550
Now say I'm copying the same file and pasting down there and I would now say limits hyphen service DEV

01:19.750 --> 01:21.550
dot properties.

01:22.470 --> 01:24.500
And I'll also create another file.

01:24.560 --> 01:28.850
Limits hyphen service Q A dot properties.

01:29.100 --> 01:31.680
So we have a Dev dot properties in the DEV dot properties.

01:31.680 --> 01:38.480
I'll put 1 and 1 1 1 and in QA dot properties.

01:38.760 --> 01:43.110
I would put two and two two two.

01:43.140 --> 01:46.500
So what we are specifying in here is by default.

01:46.710 --> 01:55.460
This is the value so the minimum is 8 8 8 8 but in DEV environment for limits service the minimum is 1

01:56.340 --> 01:58.800
For QA environment it is 2.

01:58.830 --> 02:03.340
You can specifically decide to override only the values you are interested in.

02:03.390 --> 02:09.960
Let's say you would want to pick the default for the maximum then you can comment this out then the

02:09.960 --> 02:16.810
maximum value for the DEV environment you would pick up from the default file the default file is limits

02:16.850 --> 02:17.650
hyphen service.

02:17.730 --> 02:20.580
So it would pick up the value from here.

02:20.580 --> 02:23.940
The minimum value we are overriding it in here.

02:23.940 --> 02:26.930
The other thing you can do is completely remove this line as well.

02:27.060 --> 02:31.210
For now what I'll do is I'll override all the values which are present in here.

02:31.230 --> 02:39.580
So DEV the minimum and maximum are one and one eleven respectively and in QA it's two and two twenty two respectively.

02:39.600 --> 02:45.900
Know before I would be able to see these values using the URLs what I would need to do is to commit these

02:45.900 --> 02:46.720
files in.

02:46.740 --> 02:50.430
There is one thing you need to always remember when ever we are making changes.

02:50.500 --> 02:55.280
to your files inside the GIT local configu repo.

02:55.380 --> 02:58.290
Make sure that you commit them in.

02:58.320 --> 03:04.170
You need to commit them to the local repository and only then they will be available through the spring

03:04.170 --> 03:05.460
cloud config server.

03:05.490 --> 03:12.240
So let's go head and commit them in what is the command do you remembered I'll say GIT add hyphen A to add

03:12.270 --> 03:13.400
all the files in.

03:13.560 --> 03:17.280
If I do GIT status it would show what are the changes that are present.

03:17.350 --> 03:18.990
So I am saying GIT status and it shows.

03:19.090 --> 03:19.370
OK.

03:19.410 --> 03:20.440
A new file.

03:20.460 --> 03:21.910
Couple of new files are present.

03:21.930 --> 03:25.820
So now I can go ahead and commit them into GIT commit

03:25.860 --> 03:35.280
hyphen m I would want to put the commit saying Dev and QA properties OK they're added in to the repository

03:35.280 --> 03:36.020
right now.

03:36.210 --> 03:43.470
And now I can access those properties all that I would need to do is instead the default I need to put in the

03:43.470 --> 03:50.940
environment names so let's put in QA  now you can see that when I put in QA here it is retrieving

03:50.970 --> 03:53.210
a list of properties sources.

03:53.340 --> 04:00.360
One of the important things is these lists of properties sources are in the order of priority.

04:00.450 --> 04:06.420
So the highest priority is for whatever values are configured in the QA file so limits service QA dot

04:06.450 --> 04:10.900
properties 2 and 222 and the next priority.

04:10.920 --> 04:13.130
Goes for the defaults so limits

04:13.260 --> 04:15.830
service dot properties.

04:15.900 --> 04:23.030
So if there is a value which is configured in here for example this value the value for this is two.

04:23.100 --> 04:28.740
So if there was a value which was inside the default which was not present in the QA dot properties

04:29.130 --> 04:32.130
then the value from the default will be pick up.

04:32.250 --> 04:38.210
But what ever is present in the QA has the highest priority so whatever is present limits service.

04:38.220 --> 04:42.500
QA dot properties has the highest priority for now.

04:42.540 --> 04:47.100
All that we are seeing is the list of properties sources being are that are being written.

04:47.130 --> 04:55.330
What we'll do at a later point in one of the next steps is Connect the limits service to the spring cloud config server.

04:55.620 --> 05:01.440
What we are doing right now is connecting Spring cloud config server to GIT in the latest step we'll connect

05:01.440 --> 05:07.740
the limits service to the spring cloud config server and you would see that these specific values are

05:07.770 --> 05:10.000
being picked up that's.

05:10.030 --> 05:13.390
QA What you can also do is the values for DEV.

05:13.470 --> 05:19.890
So I'm saying slash DEV and now you'd see that limits services Dev dot properties that is the highest priority

05:19.980 --> 05:23.220
one and one eleven and the next priority goes to limits

05:23.220 --> 05:26.010
service dot properties eight and eight eight eight.

05:26.460 --> 05:32.210
Don't worry about the fact that the property values are repeating in these two different files.

05:32.260 --> 05:38.580
We'll look at the fact that when I connect the limits service to this spring cloud config server it has

05:38.580 --> 05:43.530
the logic to be able to determine which is the one which is having the highest priority so it knows

05:43.530 --> 05:45.930
that the first file has the highest priority.

05:46.170 --> 05:53.820
And if you ask for the value for limits service dot minimum it will return the value 1 it will not return the default

05:53.880 --> 05:57.550
because it's overridden down here in this step.

05:57.570 --> 06:03.420
What we have done is we've configured multiple values for the limits service in DEV environment

06:03.540 --> 06:05.110
in QA environment

06:05.580 --> 06:11.520
One of the exercises you can try and do is to configure a couple of more property files for the stage and the

06:11.520 --> 06:13.470
production environment for the limits service.

06:13.470 --> 06:15.490
Until the next step.

06:15.500 --> 06:15.800
Bye bye.
