1. What Is A Web Service?
- Software System designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over network.
- Designed for machine-to-machine or applicaion-to-application interaction.
- Should be interoperable (Any other kind of application should be able to talk to the application) - Not platform independent. Irrespective of technologies they should be able to talk to the webservice.
- It should allow communication over a network.

2. How Questions Related To Web Services
- How does data exchange between applications take place?
	It happens with Request & Response. They are the basic concepts behind webservices.
- How can we make web services platform independent?
	Request & Response should be platform indepndent.
	Two popular formats - XML
						- JSON
- How does Application A know the format of Request & Response?
	Service Definition: Every web service offers a Service Definition. 
	It specifies the following
		1. The Request/Respons Format.
		2. Request Structure.
		3. Response Structure.
		4. Endpoint. (How to call the service.)

3. Web Services - Key Terminology
 - Service Provider or Server - Which host the web service
 - Service Consumer or Client - Which consumes the web service
 - Service Definition - It is the contract b/n the service provider and the service consumer.
 - Transport: It defines how a service is called is it exposed over internet or is exposed over MQ.
 	It has two formats
 			1. HTTP - over the web.
 			2. MQ	- Communication over a queue.	

4. Web Service Groups
- SOAP - based :
- REST - styled :  	
- SOAP & REST are not really comparable. 
- REST defines ann architectural approach. Whereas SOAP poses restrictions on the format of XML which is exchanged between your service provider and the service consumer.
- SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol. Actually it no longer stands for Simple Object Access Protocol. It's no longer an abbreviation anymore. SOAP is just like a request response. Any of those terms. SOAP is just a term. SOAP defines a specific way of building web services. In SOAP we use XML as the request exchange format.
