Before end this course, we want to give you a quick overview of all the important best practices when

00:08.170 --> 00:09.420
it comes to RESTful web services.

00:09.480 --> 00:17.610
One of the important models that you need to be aware of is something called Richardson Maturity Model.

00:17.830 --> 00:23.170
You're doing REST, you're calling your services RESTful but how RESTful are you?

00:23.170 --> 00:27.120
Richardson Maturity Model helps you evaluate this.

00:27.140 --> 00:32.090
It defines three different levels of RESTful services.

00:32.290 --> 00:34.530
Let's get started with level zero.

00:34.900 --> 00:37.390
What is level zero of Richardson.

00:37.440 --> 00:43.240
Maturity Model? Itâ€™s basically exposing your SOAP webservices in restful style.

00:43.300 --> 00:49.600
What do I mean? Itâ€™s exposing URLs like this. So you can see here that I'm not exposing resources

00:49.600 --> 00:52.460
here we are not talking about resources. These are just actions, Right?

00:52.470 --> 00:55.510
So I have an action saying get post.

00:55.590 --> 00:59.730
I have an action saying delete post. Do this do that.

00:59.830 --> 01:07.830
Retrieve all course details. Delete the course. All these things are basically exposing SOAP webservices in REST style.

01:08.080 --> 01:09.330
And this is level zero.

01:09.400 --> 01:15.850
So basically you take stuff from your SOPA web services and expose them in a REST style. Thatâ€™s basically

01:15.850 --> 01:18.010
what level zero is all about.

01:18.110 --> 01:25.270
Level one is all about exposing your resources with a proper URI. So in level one, you start

01:25.270 --> 01:32.010
thinking about resources. You started migrating your services from SOAP to REST and now you started

01:32.020 --> 01:38.160
thinking about what are the resources. My resources our users, todos, accounts and things like that.

01:38.410 --> 01:40.590
So this is level one. However,

01:40.600 --> 01:46.430
the important thing to note is the fact that we are not making use of the proper http methods yet.

01:46.570 --> 01:52.470
Level 2 is level 1 plus proper use of HTTP method.

01:52.630 --> 01:59.500
So if I have to delete an account, I would send a delete request, delete HTTP request method. 

01:59.560 --> 02:03.980
I use that to send a request to HTTP servers account slash ten.

02:04.040 --> 02:06.480
If I want to create a new account.

02:06.670 --> 02:07.760
I would send it to

02:07.780 --> 02:11.370
server slash account and do a post request.

02:11.530 --> 02:18.610
If you look at most of the resources that we created as part of this course they are all at level 2

02:18.880 --> 02:21.430
level 3 is level 2 plus 

02:21.550 --> 02:26.400
HATEOAS. Hyper media as the engine of application state.

02:26.500 --> 02:31.870
What we wouldn't need to return when we are at level 3 is not just the data, not just the information

02:32.110 --> 02:36.010
but also what are the next possible actions.

02:36.010 --> 02:41.570
If I am returning information of our specific post by a Facebook user.

02:41.770 --> 02:49.510
Then I would also return information about how I can like that. How I can unlike that and how I can

02:49.510 --> 02:51.480
comment on that.

02:51.520 --> 02:57.840
So we are not just talking about the information of the post but also about the next possible actions

02:58.150 --> 03:04.350
We discussed about HATEOAS briefly in the course and we converted a resource to use HATEOAS

03:04.360 --> 03:11.940
In this quick video, we looked at the three levels of Richardson Maturity Model. It helps you evaluate at

03:12.040 --> 03:18.820
what kind of maturity you are with your RESTful services implementation. Until the next video,

03:18.970 --> 03:19.300
bye-bye.
