00:03.520 --> 00:08.420
Welcome back in the last step we installed git on our local machine.

00:08.530 --> 00:11.780
one of the things you can try doing is you can use git .

00:11.860 --> 00:14.140
You can click the try git link in here.

00:14.260 --> 00:17.970
It's on the git scm dot com home page this is try get.

00:17.980 --> 00:20.300
It would take you to try dot github dot io.

00:20.420 --> 00:21.500
And over here.

00:21.670 --> 00:25.150
You can try and get familier with git.

00:25.170 --> 00:31.570
This is a beautiful way Actually it shows you a few commands you can just type them in and it would

00:31.570 --> 00:38.110
show you all the different things that are involved in creating a git repository and also maintaining

00:38.110 --> 00:39.730
a few files with it.

00:39.760 --> 00:44.470
This is something which I would definitely recommend you to do if you are new to git what will do in

00:44.470 --> 00:52.690
this step is create a new git repository and store all the files that we would want to be able to configure

00:52.860 --> 00:54.510
limits service.

00:54.920 --> 00:57.160
And also we'll try to access them.

00:57.430 --> 01:03.340
Through this spring cloud config server what I'll need to do is I'll go to the command prompt.

01:03.360 --> 01:06.300
So what you're seeing is the terminal in Mac in windows.

01:06.340 --> 01:12.160
You'd need to open your command prompt up go to some folder on your hard disk where you'd want to store

01:12.400 --> 01:15.200
the content of your git repository over here.

01:15.200 --> 01:18.510
I would want to create a new directory so the new directory.

01:18.550 --> 01:26.540
I would want to call it as git local config hyphen repo so I am creating new directory make that directory and I'll

01:26.860 --> 01:33.010
CD to that folder which we created just now we are inside that particular folder and in here I would

01:33.010 --> 01:35.350
want to initialize a new git repository.

01:35.350 --> 01:36.300
How do I do that.

01:36.520 --> 01:39.300
I can do it by using git init.

01:39.310 --> 01:42.610
This would create a new git repository.

01:42.640 --> 01:49.780
So it says initialized empty git repository in this specific folder the specific folder we have be initialize git repository

01:49.780 --> 01:50.620
is over here.

01:50.620 --> 01:56.020
Git local config repo that's the folder we are talking about that's the folder which we created in here

01:56.320 --> 02:03.970
what I'll do is I'll go to the spring cloud config server and add a link to that specific folder.

02:03.970 --> 02:06.810
How do I add a link to that folder in Eclipse.

02:06.880 --> 02:15.610
You can add an external folder as a source link right click build path you can see link source and over here

02:15.640 --> 02:21.610
I can browse to that folder where ever your git repository is created.

02:21.610 --> 02:29.410
I've created this in spring Micro services and over in folder 3 micro services I've a foldee called git local

02:29.410 --> 02:34.030
config repo that's the folder I would want to open so you can look at it in here.

02:34.030 --> 02:37.640
So this is the git local config repo folder that we've created just now.

02:37.840 --> 02:45.520
So over here git local config repo and I would say finish what I would want to do is create a new text

02:45.520 --> 02:45.960
file.

02:45.980 --> 02:49.220
In this specific folder how do I do that can say right click.

02:49.650 --> 02:50.910
New file.

02:51.400 --> 02:54.520
Let's call this in this specific file.

02:54.610 --> 02:56.680
What would we want to store.

02:56.690 --> 02:59.220
We would want to store the configuration for limits.

02:59.230 --> 03:00.100
service.

03:00.290 --> 03:02.190
So what I'll call this is limits hyphen service.

03:02.290 --> 03:04.940
hyphen service dot properties.

03:05.080 --> 03:09.720
This is the application name which we have assigned to limits hyphen service.

03:09.750 --> 03:17.980
So that's the one which I'm using and dot properties in here I can copy the properties that we have

03:17.980 --> 03:21.470
already configured in the application dot properties of limits service.

03:21.550 --> 03:22.120
Right.

03:22.400 --> 03:25.090
We are configured the minimum and the maximum.

03:25.480 --> 03:30.840
So let's copy them in and I'll give over here different set of values so that we can differentiate.

03:30.850 --> 03:39.340
So I'll give 8 and 888 once we created the file we would want to add that file to our word local git repository.

03:39.370 --> 03:42.850
You would want to commit it in how do we do that.

03:42.880 --> 03:48.890
The way we would do that is by saying git ADD and give the file name.

03:49.030 --> 03:53.270
Or I can take the shortcut by saying git add hyphen capital A.

03:53.420 --> 03:58.450
And now I can go ahead and committed to the local repository git commit.

03:58.480 --> 04:01.440
hyphen m and  first commit.

04:01.510 --> 04:05.340
So what we are doing is we are committing the change to the repository.

04:05.360 --> 04:11.010
You can see that the limits services dot properties file whichever we have added in is now committed

04:11.010 --> 04:13.240
to the local git repository.

04:13.240 --> 04:18.520
One of the things you can see is it is one file changed with two new lines that we have inserted in

04:18.760 --> 04:25.840
our local repository is ready what we'll do in the next step is we will connect our spring cloud config server

04:26.070 --> 04:29.140
to this local git repository I'll see you in the next step.
