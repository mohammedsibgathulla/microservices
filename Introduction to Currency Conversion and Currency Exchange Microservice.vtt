00:04.190 --> 00:10.130
Welcome back to understand all the concepts of spring cloud very well we need to build a couple

00:10.130 --> 00:12.030
of examples services.

00:12.350 --> 00:15.870
What we'll do is we'll build a couple of examples.

00:15.890 --> 00:20.320
Currency exchange service and the currency calculation service.

00:20.600 --> 00:27.860
We will build one service each one rest service each in each of these components will create currency

00:27.860 --> 00:34.010
exchange service application or micro service and set up a simple service there and will also set up a

00:34.010 --> 00:37.920
simple service on the currency calculation service.

00:38.310 --> 00:44.480
Let's get a quick review into the functionality of each of these services right now.

00:44.720 --> 00:52.070
The currency exchange service would use JPA to talk to the database and return the exchange value for

00:52.070 --> 00:53.380
a specific currency.

00:53.390 --> 00:56.470
Service let's say I want to convert USD to INR.

00:56.480 --> 01:00.220
What is the exchange value let's say the current exchange value 65.

01:00.320 --> 01:02.350
That's the thing which the currency exchange.

01:02.390 --> 01:10.330
Service would return talking to a database so when I invoke the currency exchange service I would need to pass in

01:10.520 --> 01:16.440
two variables which currency you want to convert from which currency you want to convert to.

01:16.550 --> 01:22.340
So here I would want to convert euro to INR the currency exchange service would return back.

01:22.340 --> 01:24.180
What is the conversion multiple.

01:24.210 --> 01:30.470
It says to convert EUR to INR the conversion multiple is 75.

01:30.470 --> 01:39.170
So one EUR is equal to 75 INR that one euro is equal to 75 Indian rupees.

01:39.180 --> 01:44.200
Currency conversion service would use the currency exchange service.

01:44.480 --> 01:51.430
So the currency converter Service wants to convert 1000 USD to INR.

01:51.620 --> 01:56.690
So what it does is it calls the currency exchange service it asks the currency exchange service ok.

01:56.720 --> 02:03.630
What is a USD worth in terms of an INR not what is the value to convert USD to.

02:03.680 --> 02:04.260
INR.

02:04.280 --> 02:07.200
It gets a value back saying 65.

02:07.430 --> 02:11.570
And it uses that to calculate 65 to 1000.

02:11.630 --> 02:16.330
And the response it gives back is sixty five thousand.

02:16.430 --> 02:22.940
So the currency converter service would make use of the currency exchange service to do the conversion

02:22.940 --> 02:29.510
from one currency to another currency of any amount that you provide what you are looking at is a very

02:29.510 --> 02:31.810
simple version of the currency converter.

02:32.060 --> 02:38.360
There can be other services in the currency converter which would convert from a bag of currencies to

02:38.480 --> 02:39.790
one currency.

02:39.980 --> 02:44.990
What we have is a couple of services talking to each other the currency calculation service talking to

02:44.990 --> 02:52.690
a currency exchange service we will use these two micro services as an example while we talk about spring

02:52.840 --> 02:59.850
cloud in detail what we'll do in the subsequent steps is to set these up.

02:59.870 --> 03:05.570
So in these next eight steps what we'll do is we'll set up the currency exchange service and we'll set

03:05.570 --> 03:11.390
up the currency calculation service to call the currency exchange service until the next step.

03:11.400 --> 03:11.720
Bye bye.
