In the last couple of videos, we were introduced to the ‘What’ devote and the ‘How’ of Web services. In this

00:09.360 --> 00:15.990
Video, let’s revise some of the key terminology that is associated with Web services. Request, Response, Message

00:15.990 --> 00:17.370
exchange format.

00:17.430 --> 00:19.080
We’ll look at what is a service provider.

00:19.080 --> 00:20.730
What is a service consumer. What is a

00:20.730 --> 00:24.370
service definition and what is transport.

00:24.490 --> 00:32.340
Let's start with a request and response. Request is the input of our service and response is the output

00:32.340 --> 00:40.030
from a web service. Message exchange format is the format of the request and the response.

00:40.150 --> 00:41.730
 Are we using XML?

00:41.730 --> 00:43.240
Are we using JSON?

00:43.500 --> 00:47.230
What is the format of the request and response.

00:47.280 --> 00:51.020
That’s basically the message exchange format.

00:51.030 --> 00:57.270
The next key terminology is service provider and service consumer. Application A

00:57.270 --> 01:03.820
wants to consume a service from the web service which is present in here.

01:03.870 --> 01:13.560
The web service here is called a service provider. Service provider is the one which hosts the web service.

01:13.850 --> 01:18.980
The service consumer is the one which is consuming the web service. Application A

01:18.990 --> 01:23.820
in this example is a consumer of the web service.

01:23.880 --> 01:31.170
In this example, the java application, the dot net application and the PHP application are the consumers of the web

01:31.200 --> 01:36.190
Service. We looked at the service provider - the guy who is providing this service.

01:36.300 --> 01:39.300
Service consumer is who is using the service.

01:39.390 --> 01:43.380
The next important terminology is service definition.

01:43.380 --> 01:50.780
The service definition is the contract between the service provider and the service consumers.

01:50.810 --> 01:55.580
The service definition defines what is the format of the request and response.

01:55.600 --> 01:59.810
XML or JSON? What is the structure of the request.

02:00.000 --> 02:05.060
What is the structure of the response and where is this service available.

02:05.070 --> 02:08.480
That’s the end point. Endpoint defines

02:08.610 --> 02:11.590
what URL is the service is exposed at.

02:11.620 --> 02:19.080
How can these service consumer call this service which is exposed by the service provider.

02:19.170 --> 02:29.580
The other key terminology is transport. Transport defines how a service is called. Is the service exposed

02:29.610 --> 02:30.590
over Internet.

02:30.600 --> 02:33.320
So I'll be given a URL and I'll call it.

02:33.450 --> 02:38.080
Or is the service exposed over a Queue. Two popular formats

02:38.090 --> 02:40.620
are HTTP and MQ.

02:40.620 --> 02:42.040
HTTP is

02:42.060 --> 02:49.800
basically over the web. Just like you type a URL in the browser, in a similar way application A would call

02:49.830 --> 02:51.160
the web service.

02:51.210 --> 02:58.980
The other format is MQ is to use communication over a queue. The service requester would place a message

02:59.040 --> 03:03.370
in the queue. The service provider would be listening on the queue.

03:03.510 --> 03:10.370
And as soon as there's a request on the queue it would take the request, do the processing of it, create

03:10.400 --> 03:17.640
the response and put it back in the queue and the service requester would get the response from the queue.

03:18.120 --> 03:20.690
The transport which is used is MQ.

03:20.700 --> 03:25.570
It does not necessarily be Websphere MQ, it can be any other MQs as well.

03:25.740 --> 03:29.050
But the fact is, the communication happens over queue.

03:29.070 --> 03:34.300
This is called a web service which is exposed over the transport MQ.

03:34.300 --> 03:41.040
The last key terminology we looked at was transport. Transport indicates whether the service is exposed

03:41.100 --> 03:48.480
over a queue or whether its exposed over the web. Thats the Internet. Idea behind this video is to provide

03:48.480 --> 03:55.770
a quick overview of all the key terminology which is associated with Web services.

03:55.860 --> 03:59.320
Most of this is what we have discussed in the earlier videos.

03:59.610 --> 04:05.880
We wanted to make sure that there is no ambiguity in understanding of these key terminology because

04:05.880 --> 04:11.140
we would be using this terminology during the next steps of this course.

04:11.360 --> 04:12.770
Until the next video, bye-bye.
