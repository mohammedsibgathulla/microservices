00:03.320 --> 00:10.030
Welcome back in the previous step we used a direct URL to execute the currency exchange service

00:10.510 --> 00:13.960
through the Zuul API gateway proxy.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.520
When we use this URL.

00:15.720 --> 00:25.150
This is the port for the API proxies so Gateway proxies running on 8 7 6 5 and we use the proxy to execute

00:25.150 --> 00:32.290
the currency exchange service what we want to do now is when the currency calculation Service is calling

00:32.290 --> 00:33.700
the currency exchange service.

00:33.790 --> 00:41.430
We don't want the call to happen directly we would want the call to go through the API gateway that's basically

00:41.500 --> 00:42.520
Zuul server.

00:42.610 --> 00:53.350
So how do we get the currency calculation service the request from here to go through the Zuul API gateway proxy thing which

00:53.590 --> 01:00.160
actually makes the call inside the currency conversion service is the proxy the currency exchange service

01:00.520 --> 01:01.550
proxy.

01:01.570 --> 01:05.470
The thing is we already configured the naming server.

01:05.500 --> 01:11.910
The thing is all the important things that we use are registered with the naming server.

01:12.010 --> 01:16.540
Number one the Exchange service is the currency exchange service is register the currency conversion.

01:16.540 --> 01:21.500
Service is registered this Zuul API gateway also switches.

01:21.780 --> 01:28.450
So all that we need to do here is I would need to say OK do not connect to the currency exchange service

01:29.080 --> 01:34.660
feign connect to the Zuul API proxy.

01:34.660 --> 01:37.300
I would want to get the application name for it.

01:37.330 --> 01:44.190
So I'll say application dot properties I would want Zuul API gateway servers name.

01:44.280 --> 01:46.460
I'll use this feign client.

01:46.480 --> 01:50.140
You need to make a call to Netflix Zuul API gateway.

01:50.190 --> 01:53.950
Server talk to the naming server and get the URI for it.

01:54.160 --> 01:54.780
That's cool.

01:54.790 --> 01:57.410
So now it would go through the API.

01:57.640 --> 02:01.630
Server However there is another thing that we would need to change.

02:01.630 --> 02:05.950
The thing is URI no longer currency exchange from EUR to INR.

02:06.210 --> 02:09.880
There is something else that needs to be appended to this.

02:09.940 --> 02:17.590
So you need to append the name of the application which is exposing that service so would need to append in currency

02:17.590 --> 02:19.350
exchange service to the

02:19.380 --> 02:20.020
URI.

02:20.320 --> 02:26.130
So let's go to the service proxy in the get mapping append that stuff in.

02:26.140 --> 02:35.310
So I'm appending currency exchange service coming this out and I'll copy it again so that we have a history of

02:35.310 --> 02:37.420
what we are doing in here present.

02:37.740 --> 02:40.090
So that's basically what we have right now.

02:40.110 --> 02:41.880
So currency exchange service.

02:42.230 --> 02:46.860
Now I can save this you can see that the currency conversion service application is launching

02:46.860 --> 02:52.780
up ensure that you have all these applications shown on the screen running.

02:52.830 --> 02:58.290
We need the Eureka server we need the Zuul API gateway and we need currency conversion Service and the

02:58.290 --> 03:00.410
currency exchange service running.

03:00.660 --> 03:07.250
So once you have all these running all that you need to do is to hit the URL currency converter feign.

03:07.290 --> 03:09.000
So we are going through the feign.

03:09.030 --> 03:14.340
So currency converter feign from USD to INR quantity 10.

03:14.360 --> 03:15.480
So let's refresh.

03:15.480 --> 03:18.170
This is the same URL which we used earlier.

03:18.300 --> 03:26.820
I'm looking at the log for the Netflix Zuul API gateway server application you can use this hallow in here to navigate

03:26.820 --> 03:33.000
between which logs you'd want to see I'm looking at the Netflix Zuul API gateway server so I am seeing a couple of

03:33.000 --> 03:41.340
logs which are present in here what I'll do this I'll remove that and execute the request again to see the latest

03:41.360 --> 03:46.830
one you can see that the URI is getting logged some details about the request actually not a lot of

03:46.830 --> 03:53.320
details about the request its just printing the request wrapper these are shown inside the log if

03:53.320 --> 04:00.000
you want to add more details you can go to the locking filter and add more request details in there.

04:00.250 --> 04:05.850
What you are seeing right now is whenever I'm calling the currency converter service.

04:05.920 --> 04:13.420
So whenever we are calling the currency calculation service through feign what's happening this is being

04:13.420 --> 04:19.540
routed through the API gateway the service call is directly not going to the currency exchange service.

04:19.540 --> 04:24.580
It is being routed through the gateway the gateway is executing the filter which is the logging

04:24.580 --> 04:25.180
filter.

04:25.420 --> 04:32.920
And invoking the currency exchange service what we're doing now is intercepting the call between the currency

04:32.920 --> 04:36.360
calculation service and the currency exchange service.

04:36.520 --> 04:43.290
Or let's say I would want the API gateway to be executed even before the currency calculation service is

04:43.330 --> 04:47.900
invoked so at this point before a consumer invokes the service.

04:47.980 --> 04:54.040
I would want it to go through the API gateway and later for the second time it would go through the

04:54.040 --> 05:00.240
API gateway here when the currency calculation service would call the currency exchange service.

05:00.310 --> 05:01.560
How do we do that.

05:01.570 --> 05:03.580
So this is the URL which we are using until now.

05:03.730 --> 05:11.260
What I would need to do is to send this request through the API gateway Zuul API gateway.

05:11.390 --> 05:18.680
The URI would be app name hyphen URI right so the app name for the currency conversion application.

05:19.140 --> 05:24.790
Let's go to the application dot properties to get that currency conversion service the app name is

05:24.790 --> 05:26.420
currency conversion service.

05:26.680 --> 05:28.460
Let's pick that up.

05:28.540 --> 05:35.140
That's the one which would go in here in the URI is the complete URI down here.

05:35.390 --> 05:42.310
It's localhost eight seven six five current conversion service currency converter feign from USD

05:42.390 --> 05:47.730
to INR quantity ten OK very long request or actually very long.

05:47.740 --> 05:53.440
URI I'll open up a new window put this in before executing this.

05:53.500 --> 06:00.090
I would go down to the Netflix Zuul API gateway server application and clear the 

06:00.180 --> 06:03.680
console and let's execute this right now.

06:04.120 --> 06:10.070
You should see two requests through the Netflix API gateway console.

06:10.520 --> 06:19.230
You could see two times the logging filter is being executed the first time the call is to the currency

06:19.410 --> 06:25.230
conversion service so you can see that the current conversion service currency converter feign this

06:25.220 --> 06:26.840
is you the URI which being used.

06:26.950 --> 06:33.040
And next when the currency conversion Service is calling the currency exchange service again it's going

06:33.040 --> 06:35.160
through the Zuul API gateway.

06:35.290 --> 06:37.100
That's pretty cool isn't it.

06:37.180 --> 06:43.570
What we are doing in here is we're trying to make every call to the micro services go through the Zuul

06:43.780 --> 06:45.070
API Gateway.

06:45.100 --> 06:51.430
This would ensure that we have logs about everything if we want analytics we can do that implement security

06:51.610 --> 06:58.570
you can implement them as part of your API gateway in this step and the previous steps we talked about

06:59.070 --> 07:06.730
API gateways we implemented a logging filter with an API gateway and ensure that all the calls go through

07:06.730 --> 07:08.560
the API gateway.

07:08.620 --> 07:11.940
The next step we would switch towards distributed tracing.

07:11.950 --> 07:13.910
Until then bye bye.
