The last few videos, we looked at the basics of Web services. We understood the key terminology which

00:07.150 --> 00:14.370
are associated with web services. In this video, we will take a quick look at the different types of

00:14.420 --> 00:17.620
web services, kinds of web services, groups of web services.

00:17.630 --> 00:25.900
However, you'd want to call them. SOAP and REST. One thing to remember is the fact that SOAP and

00:25.900 --> 00:28.820
REST are not really comparable.

00:28.870 --> 00:32.350
It's not really an apple to apple comparison.

00:32.380 --> 00:36.710
REST defines an architectural approach.

00:36.820 --> 00:45.700
Whereas SOAP poses restrictions on the format of XML which is exchanged between your service provider and

00:45.700 --> 00:47.110
the service consumer.

00:47.200 --> 00:53.910
Let's get started with SOAP. SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol.

00:53.980 --> 00:58.370
Actually it no longer stands for Simple Object Access Protocol.

00:58.390 --> 01:05.310
It's no longer an abbreviation anymore. SOAP is just like a request response. Any of those terms.

01:05.350 --> 01:13.690
SOAP is just a term. SOAP defines a specific way of building web services. In SOAP we use XML as 

01:13.690 --> 01:16.510
the request exchange format.

01:16.570 --> 01:20.890
So I have a Facebook application which is talking to TODO application.

01:20.890 --> 01:26.860
Facebook is sending a XML request and TODO application is sending back an XML response.  An example

01:26.860 --> 01:30.550
of a request is shown below.  Get course details request.

01:30.550 --> 01:32.210
So this is using again XML.

01:32.390 --> 01:36.790
Is this SOAP? Are Facebook and TODO applications communicating using SOAP.

01:36.790 --> 01:37.400
Nope.

01:37.480 --> 01:40.290
This is not sufficient to be SOAP.

01:40.290 --> 01:47.450
Important thing is SOAP defines a specific XML request and response structure.

01:47.560 --> 01:54.070
If you're using SOAP then you have to use this structure. So you have to create a SOAP and envelope which

01:54.070 --> 01:57.920
contains a SOAP header and a SOAP body.

01:58.150 --> 02:04.240
The header contains meta information like authentication, authorization, signatures and things like

02:04.240 --> 02:04.790
that.

02:05.090 --> 02:10.460
Body is where you really put the real content of your request or your response.

02:10.660 --> 02:17.230
So if you're actually saying you are creating a SOAP web service then you have to adhere to this request

02:17.350 --> 02:19.650
and response format.

02:19.840 --> 02:25.050
You should use a SOAP envelope with a header and a body in the request and the response.

02:25.060 --> 02:30.550
So if you're using soap web services then Facebook and TODO application have to communicate using a SOAP

02:30.610 --> 02:38.460
XML requests and a SOAP XML response. And example response is shown in here. So you have a SOAP envelope.

02:38.530 --> 02:40.030
You have a header.

02:40.030 --> 02:41.850
Here the header is empty.

02:41.890 --> 02:46.470
You have a body with the content of the response.

02:46.510 --> 02:55.360
When we look at the big picture SOAP defines a format for your request and the response. SOAP does not pose

02:55.390 --> 02:58.930
any restrictions on your transport.

02:59.290 --> 03:08.140
You can either use HTTP or MQ. So you can communicate over the web, over the Internet or you can use queues

03:08.140 --> 03:10.220
to communicate as well.

03:10.390 --> 03:18.000
And in SOAP, the service definition is typically done using something called web service definition.

03:18.000 --> 03:23.480
Language. WSDL. Web service definition language.

03:23.480 --> 03:32.800
A WSDL defines the end point. Basically where your service is exposed at. It defines all the operations that

03:32.800 --> 03:34.540
are exposed.

03:34.720 --> 03:39.150
Get all codes details, add a new course, delete course.

03:39.360 --> 03:43.320
So what are all the operations that are allowed.

03:43.700 --> 03:48.420
And also it specifies the request and response structure.

03:48.610 --> 03:54.380
If I want to get all the details of a course, how do I send the request. If I want to delete a course,

03:54.430 --> 03:56.130
How do I send a request?

03:56.410 --> 03:59.140
And what kind of response can I expect?

03:59.160 --> 04:03.080
WSDL is the service definition for your SOAP

04:03.110 --> 04:11.800
Services. We will talk about all the details of a WSDL later in the course when we talk about SOAP

04:11.890 --> 04:13.160
services in detail.

04:13.210 --> 04:22.780
In summary, SOAP is all about adhering to the services XML structure. Adhering to the envelop header and

04:22.780 --> 04:23.530
the body.

04:23.560 --> 04:28.740
Once you have your request and response in that structure then you can say you are developing.

04:28.750 --> 04:34.440
SOAP web services. Now that we talk a lot about the SOAP Web services. In the next video, 

04:34.580 --> 04:38.540
we would be talking about REST web services. Until then, bye-bye.
