00:03.920 --> 00:06.940
Welcome back in the previous steps we installed RabbitMq.

00:06.950 --> 00:12.320
We created a component for  Zipkin Tracing server and Zipkin Distributed Tracing server is listening

00:12.320 --> 00:14.490
on RabbitMq for messages.

00:14.690 --> 00:21.700
What we would need to do is to connect our micro services to put the messages for the Zipkin Distributed Tracing server

00:21.700 --> 00:23.410
on RabbitMq.

00:23.460 --> 00:25.770
Once place messages on here.

00:25.880 --> 00:30.730
These messages will be picked up and we would we would see them on the zipkin dash board.

00:30.740 --> 00:36.230
So in this step what we'll do is we will connect the currency calculation service and the currency exchange

00:36.230 --> 00:41.690
service along with the API gateway to rabbit MQ to be able to do that.

00:41.720 --> 00:48.710
We would need to add a couple of dependencies let's add them to all our Micro services.

00:49.040 --> 00:50.070
Let's get started now.

00:50.150 --> 00:55.310
I'm going to our pom dot xml I'm in the api gateway server pom dot xml.

00:55.310 --> 01:01.220
We already have spring cloud starter sleuth so that assigns an ID next what we would need to do is

01:01.250 --> 01:06.190
we would want to create a message in the format that it expects.

01:06.200 --> 01:10.580
So I would need to add zipkin so we would want to connect the zipkin.

01:10.620 --> 01:15.950
So we added dependency on sping cloud starter sleuth zipkin.

01:15.980 --> 01:18.450
Now how do I send a message to the zipkin.

01:18.470 --> 01:20.320
I would want to send it over MQ.

01:20.330 --> 01:22.790
You would want to use rabbit MQ.

01:22.810 --> 01:29.980
Which uses the amqp protocol so we would need to add a dependency for that as well.

01:30.190 --> 01:35.270
The dependency for that is spring cloud starter bus.

01:35.270 --> 01:43.150
Amqp So these are the two dependencies that you need starter sleuth zipkin and starter bus.

01:43.190 --> 01:49.350
amqp you can save this project and copy the same dependencies into currency exchange service pom dot xml

01:50.280 --> 01:50.640
where is sleuth.

01:50.660 --> 01:52.700
I'll just put this below the sleuth.

01:52.730 --> 01:59.280
So now we have sleuth zipkin and bus amqp in pom dot xml for currency exchange service and I'll

01:59.320 --> 02:04.490
also go to the currency conversion service pom dot xml one of the important things to note is that the name

02:04.550 --> 02:07.200
is spring cloud sleuth zipkin.

02:07.310 --> 02:10.770
I added in starter that's starter is not their.

02:10.790 --> 02:13.160
Actually spring cloud sleuth zipkin.

02:13.310 --> 02:19.370
And this would reslove the error we had I will caught the same thing into the currency exchange service i will remove the

02:19.460 --> 02:21.360
starter from here as well.

02:21.470 --> 02:23.940
And who are the currency conversion.

02:23.940 --> 02:28.450
Services as well so what we are basically doing is adding a couple of dependencies.

02:28.580 --> 02:33.570
We're already logging messages into the log with the ID using a sleuth.

02:33.890 --> 02:41.300
So when we add the dependency for spring cloud sleuth zipkin what would happen is we would start logging

02:41.300 --> 02:46.370
these messages in the format that zipkin would be able to understand.

02:46.550 --> 02:56.570
And also we are adding amqp dependency so we are establishing a connection to the amqp Bus and the

02:56.570 --> 03:04.310
default amqp installation which is used is a rabbit MQ So we are also adding a dependency so that we

03:04.310 --> 03:06.560
get a connection to rabbit MQ.

03:06.590 --> 03:15.920
So we would be able to put a zipkin message on rabbit mQ In this step we added the dependencies that

03:15.920 --> 03:21.430
are needed for sleuth zipkin and the connection to the rabbit MQ.

03:21.460 --> 03:27.570
into api gateway into our currency connection service and the currency exchange.

03:27.710 --> 03:31.680
service in the next step we would try running all of them together.

03:31.850 --> 03:32.820
Until then bye bye.
