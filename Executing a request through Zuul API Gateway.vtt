00:03.780 --> 00:08.270
Come back the previous step we had implemented a component for the Zuul API gateway.

00:08.490 --> 00:17.520
server we implemented Zuul logging filter to log the request down in this step what we'll do is we will execute

00:17.520 --> 00:23.580
a few requests that would be intercepted by the Zuul logging filter or the Zuul API gateway server.

00:23.700 --> 00:31.850
Let's launch the API gateway server application up before launching the Netflix Zuul API gateway.

00:31.980 --> 00:35.850
Server up using right click run as java application.

00:35.850 --> 00:40.920
Make sure that you have at least launched up a naming server so you should have the naming.

00:40.920 --> 00:44.490
Server up and running so Netflix Eureka naming server application.

00:44.730 --> 00:47.230
This should be up and running launch.

00:47.240 --> 00:52.110
One of the instances of the currency exchange service so I'll launch up eight thousand.

00:52.230 --> 00:58.170
Make sure that a currency service currency conversion service application is up and running on eight

00:58.170 --> 01:05.280
thousand one hundred and then I would start running the Netflix Zuul API gateway server application so

01:05.280 --> 01:13.010
all that you need to do is go on to the application file in here do a right click and do a run as java application.

01:13.240 --> 01:16.500
So now if we launch the whole thing up.

01:16.530 --> 01:18.790
This is the situation you should be in you should see.

01:18.940 --> 01:22.300
Four applications running at this point.

01:22.440 --> 01:28.600
So you would have the Netflix Eureka naming server applications running the currency exchange service

01:28.620 --> 01:33.230
application is running on eight thousand the currency conversion service application is running on a thousand

01:33.230 --> 01:33.910
one hundred.

01:34.110 --> 01:38.770
And we have the Netflix Zuul API gateway server application running as well.

01:38.940 --> 01:48.050
If you refresh the Eureka server the naming server local host 8 7 6 1 you would see that all the services

01:48.110 --> 01:52.820
are registered in here you'd see that there's a currency conversion service there is a currency exchange

01:52.820 --> 01:57.370
service and the Netflix Zuul API gateway server.

01:57.380 --> 02:01.460
These are all registered with Eureka.

02:01.620 --> 02:07.460
That's cool the way we typically invoke the currency exchange service.

02:07.460 --> 02:12.810
Is just typing in localhost 8000 currency exchange from EUR to INR.

02:12.830 --> 02:14.240
So let's refresh this.

02:14.300 --> 02:17.550
You'd see that the service would execute fine.

02:17.600 --> 02:22.070
It would return port 8000 because that's the one which we are executing it on.

02:22.220 --> 02:24.460
And it says what is the conversion multiple.

02:24.530 --> 02:25.300
That's cool.

02:25.370 --> 02:27.850
This is how we executed this service until now.

02:27.910 --> 02:34.760
Now for this service I would want to execute it through this Zuul API gateway.

02:34.790 --> 02:43.500
So what do we want to do we would want to execute this request through Zuul API gateway if a

02:43.500 --> 02:48.610
consumer directly calls this URL the request will not go through this Zuul gateway.

02:48.620 --> 02:54.080
How do we make the request to go through this Zuul API gateway the port at which we configure the Zuul

02:54.080 --> 02:55.190
API gateways.

02:55.190 --> 02:56.350
Eight seven six five.

02:56.360 --> 02:58.040
So let's pick that up.

02:58.070 --> 03:03.820
So the URL for invoking a request through the API gateway would be localhost.

03:04.280 --> 03:05.550
Eight seven six five.

03:05.560 --> 03:11.020
That's the URL of the API gateway 8765 that's the port.

03:11.020 --> 03:13.490
So localhost eight seven six five.

03:13.630 --> 03:20.400
The next thing that you would need to append in here is the application name.

03:20.470 --> 03:25.250
And after that would go your URI of the service.

03:25.300 --> 03:30.780
So the application name of this currency exchange what is the application name for the currency exchange.

03:30.820 --> 03:35.300
You can see it on the naming server on the naming server.

03:35.320 --> 03:45.500
We see that it's currency exchange service or I can open up application dot properties of the currency

03:45.500 --> 03:55.110
exchange service and pick up the currency exchange service from here so application name it's currency exchange

03:55.110 --> 04:03.460
service and the URI of the service is currency change from to Ok.

04:03.490 --> 04:11.860
This is a very long URL so that's the complete URL to execute a request through the API

04:11.890 --> 04:18.820
Gateway what the API Gateway does is it would log the request because we implemented a logging filter

04:19.240 --> 04:25.180
and it would send the request out to the micro service the currency exchange micro service.

04:25.360 --> 04:26.480
So let's see what would happen.

04:26.480 --> 04:30.190
Now let's go ahead and execute this long.

04:30.200 --> 04:30.910
URL indeed.

04:31.180 --> 04:35.050
You can see that I'm getting a response back.

04:35.230 --> 04:41.200
So I'm sending the request to the API gateway instead of directly calling the micro services.

04:41.350 --> 04:43.570
Now what's happening on the API gateway let's see.

04:43.580 --> 04:47.430
So this is the log for the Netflix Zuul API gateway server application.

04:47.500 --> 04:55.360
You could see that the content of the request is printed on this Zuul API gateway server you can see that

04:55.360 --> 04:56.450
the request is printed.

04:56.450 --> 04:59.730
The request URI is also being printed in here.

04:59.740 --> 05:02.740
So it says currency exchange service currency exchange from EUR.

05:02.780 --> 05:10.660
To INR in this step we executed a request through the API gateway however what we would want to

05:10.660 --> 05:18.040
be able to do is to send the request from the currency conversion service to the currency exchange service.

05:18.040 --> 05:22.070
I would want them to be routed through the API gateway.

05:22.450 --> 05:24.650
Let's see how to act in the next step.
