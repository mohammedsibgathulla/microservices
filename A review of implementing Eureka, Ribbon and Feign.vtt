00:03.220 --> 00:10.210
Welcome back in this step let's take a pause and take a quick review of what we have been doing until

00:10.210 --> 00:10.750
now.

00:10.990 --> 00:17.260
We started with creating a couple of Micro services currency calculation service and currency exchange

00:17.260 --> 00:24.400
service currency calculation service is a consumer of the currency exchange service.

00:24.550 --> 00:31.780
When we started off we had a direct URL connection between the currency calculation service and the currency

00:31.780 --> 00:32.910
exchange service.

00:33.430 --> 00:38.920
So if we have other currency exchange services which are coming up the currency calculation service but

00:39.130 --> 00:47.130
not able to talk to them and to be able to get load balancing the introduced ribbon.

00:47.380 --> 00:54.610
Before that we added feign the currency calculation service to make it easy to call the rest services

00:54.610 --> 01:01.660
from currency exchange service with feign writing client services for restfull webservices becomes very

01:01.660 --> 01:09.970
easy after that we added ribbon and we load balance between two instances of the currency exchange service

01:09.970 --> 01:15.430
so all the calls that were coming in from the currency calculation service were distributed between

01:15.550 --> 01:17.890
two instances of the currency exchange.

01:17.900 --> 01:25.720
service the way we achieve that is by hard coding the URLs of the currency exchange service in the application

01:25.720 --> 01:30.690
dot properties of the currency conversion service we thought that that's not good enough.

01:30.760 --> 01:33.820
And we introduced namings server we connected.

01:33.820 --> 01:35.520
Currency calculation service.

01:35.660 --> 01:38.840
And the currency exchange service to the naming server.

01:39.070 --> 01:45.610
And what we did is instead of hard coding the values are hard coading the URLs of the currency exchange.

01:45.620 --> 01:52.180
service with the currency calculation service we said talk to the naming server and get the URLs of

01:52.180 --> 01:59.890
the currency exchange service in the last step we were able to dynamically bring up and send down the currency

01:59.890 --> 02:00.220
exchange.

02:00.220 --> 02:06.100
services if there were four currency exchange services which were alive then we were distributing

02:06.100 --> 02:07.360
the load between them.

02:07.430 --> 02:14.080
If two of them are brought down the remaining two are the ones which would handle all the requests we

02:14.090 --> 02:21.190
were able to dynamically bring up services bring them down without causing a problem to the consumers

02:21.430 --> 02:24.190
without causing a problem to the currency calculation service.

02:24.190 --> 02:31.510
This is what is needed in the world of micro services in the world of micro services.

02:31.510 --> 02:37.780
There are so many small services which are talking to each other that we would want to be able to bring

02:37.780 --> 02:44.790
new instances of them take all the instances down without causing a problem to any of the other consumers.

02:44.920 --> 02:51.340
And that what we have set up between the currency calculation service and the currency exchange service.

02:51.640 --> 02:58.220
and the tools we used to be able to do that are A the naming server and B.

02:58.300 --> 03:06.850
Ribbon C is feign naming server is the one which offers registration that service registration and service

03:06.880 --> 03:16.210
discovery functionality ribbon provides the client side load balancing facilities so it enables client

03:16.210 --> 03:24.460
calculation service to distribute the load between multiple service providers and we used feign to make

03:24.460 --> 03:30.310
sure that the code that we write inside the currency calculation service to call the currency exchange.

03:30.330 --> 03:33.070
Service is very simple.

03:33.070 --> 03:41.020
In the subsequent steps we would shift our attention to its monitoring and troubleshooting when we have

03:41.020 --> 03:42.630
multiple micro services.

03:42.790 --> 03:48.340
We would want to have great awareness of what's happening between them and we would want to be able to

03:48.340 --> 03:51.880
troubleshoot issues between them very easily.

03:51.890 --> 03:54.330
Let's talk about that in the next section.

03:54.400 --> 03:55.290
Until then Bye bye.
