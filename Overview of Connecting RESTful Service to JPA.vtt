00:01.390 --> 00:09.160
Welcome back! In the previous steps, you would have learnt about JPA and we're ready to add JPA to the RESTful

00:09.160 --> 00:11.570
services that we created earlier.

00:11.710 --> 00:18.700
So in this step and the subsequent steps we would take the application which we built as part of our

00:18.700 --> 00:20.890
RESTful web services steps.

00:20.890 --> 00:27.320
This is the one where we talked about versioning, security, filtering and all that kind of stuff.

00:27.340 --> 00:28.630
So we'll take the RESTfull web services

00:28.650 --> 00:35.220
application resources and we will add JPA to them. What we'll do over the next few steps is

00:35.300 --> 00:43.300
we will take this user. We will actually make it something which is an entity managed by JPA and we will also

00:43.300 --> 00:45.310
create different user resource.

00:45.310 --> 00:52.710
So what we'll do is we'll take this users resource and step by step convert it from using the user dao service

00:52.720 --> 01:00.100
which is actually is a static arraylist, we would change that from this list to talk to the database.

01:00.100 --> 01:05.620
So we will have a new thing called user repository which is created which would be the one which would

01:05.620 --> 01:12.900
be talking to the database and we would step by step convert the user source to use JPA instead of the hard

01:12.900 --> 01:13.360
coded arraylist.

01:13.370 --> 01:19.450
We had a great time learning how to develop RESTful web services and I'm sure you'd have an

01:19.480 --> 01:25.660
equally interesting time converting this application to JPA. Until I you in the first step, bye-bye.
