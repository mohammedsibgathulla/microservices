00:03.240 --> 00:07.590
The previous step we talked about the importance of API gateways.

00:07.590 --> 00:13.650
You said we would want to intercept all calls between all micro services and have them pass through

00:13.890 --> 00:15.430
API gateway.

00:15.690 --> 00:19.380
Netflix provides an implementation called Zuul.

00:19.490 --> 00:23.500
There are three steps to setting up a zuul server.

00:23.550 --> 00:27.840
number one is create a component for it.

00:27.830 --> 00:35.700
So we would want to create a component for these zuul API gateways server the second thing is to decide what

00:35.700 --> 00:39.800
should it do when it intercepts a request.

00:39.810 --> 00:47.460
So when a currency calculation service is called to currency exchange services intercepted what should

00:47.460 --> 00:51.660
this Zuul API gateway do you need to implement that.

00:51.670 --> 00:58.410
That's the second part the third part is to make sure that all the important requests are configured

00:58.410 --> 00:59.490
to pass through.

00:59.510 --> 01:01.390
The Zuul API gateway.

01:01.740 --> 01:07.710
The first part is to set the component of the second part is to decide what things that the Zuul API should

01:07.710 --> 01:09.690
do when it intercepts a request.

01:09.750 --> 01:14.680
The third part is to make sure that the right requests go through this Zuul API.

01:14.940 --> 01:21.040
Let's get started with the first part that basically setting up a Zuul API gateway server as usual.

01:21.120 --> 01:22.730
Let's go to Star dot spring dot io.

01:22.770 --> 01:27.900
you can almost make it the homepage of your browser because we are going to do it so many times

01:28.290 --> 01:32.160
and we're going to use Maven Java and two zero zero m3.

01:32.180 --> 01:41.990
The group id does not change the artifact id that we would be using now is Netflix Zuul API gateway server.

01:42.120 --> 01:48.360
I would remove all the dependencies that we had selected earlier in the dependences I would want in

01:48.360 --> 01:48.870
here.

01:48.950 --> 01:54.570
Number one you would want to use Zuul So that's number one API gateway features.

01:54.930 --> 02:00.320
And I would also want to add Zuul to the Eureka..

02:00.390 --> 02:06.060
So when ever Zuul instances up and running I'd want to be able to see that in Eureka.

02:06.450 --> 02:15.570
So I'll add Eureka discovery as well and as usual lets add actuator and dev tools as well let's generate

02:15.600 --> 02:21.300
the project extract the zip to a specific folder on your machine and let's import into eclipse.

02:21.330 --> 02:23.530
We already have five projects in that eclipse.

02:23.620 --> 02:32.980
And here comes one more file import existing Mavan projects and the folder I have it in is three Micro 

02:32.990 --> 02:36.170
services Netflix Zuul API gateway server.

02:36.660 --> 02:38.210
let's Click finish.

02:38.260 --> 02:44.230
It would take a while if this is the first time you are importing this specific component.

02:44.320 --> 02:50.720
That's basically a Zuul API gateway They will download all dependencies and set the project up for you.

02:50.760 --> 02:53.400
The Netflix Zuul API Gateway server application file.

02:53.480 --> 02:55.370
That's the spring boot application file.

02:55.530 --> 02:57.480
Over here we need to do a couple of things.

02:57.480 --> 03:04.140
One is we would want to enable these Zuul proxy so we would this is the Zuul server on the Zuul server you need

03:04.140 --> 03:09.730
to have this annotation enable zuul proxy import it in.

03:09.820 --> 03:13.540
And the other thing is we would want to register with the name server.

03:13.590 --> 03:16.000
So I'll need to say enable discovery client

03:19.090 --> 03:20.180
Let's organize the imports.

03:20.240 --> 03:21.900
This would also be successful.

03:22.250 --> 03:28.920
And the other thing we would want to do is to configure the application name the server port and the Eureka URL.

03:29.450 --> 03:32.340
Because I have opened a lot of applications right now.

03:32.440 --> 03:32.900
My eclipse is.

03:33.140 --> 03:38.300
acting a little slow let's not really worry about it I'm opening up the application dot properties

03:38.360 --> 03:42.880
dot currency conversion service and I'm copying these three properties from here.

03:42.980 --> 03:47.540
I've copied them into the application dot properties which is present in the Netflix zuul API gateway

03:47.540 --> 03:48.470
server.

03:48.770 --> 03:56.480
The application name we already know that let's copied out from our home page and put it down here.

03:56.710 --> 03:58.570
Netflix Zuul API gateway server.

03:58.660 --> 04:02.940
The port we want to use for the gateway server is eight seven six five.

04:03.110 --> 04:07.450
You can see that the port which we decided to use for the Netflix Zuul API gateway server

04:07.470 --> 04:09.470
is eight seven six five.

04:09.590 --> 04:16.370
And that's what we have configured in here and the Eureka server URL it's same as what we used earlier.

04:16.490 --> 04:17.510
That's cool.

04:17.900 --> 04:21.980
The configuration for the Netflix gateway server is ready.

04:21.980 --> 04:24.950
The API server at the API gateway server is ready.

04:24.950 --> 04:30.070
However we did not tell it what it should do when it intercepts a request.

04:30.080 --> 04:32.970
Let's define that in the next step.

04:33.230 --> 04:33.700
Until then bye bye.
