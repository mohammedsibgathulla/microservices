Before we get our hands dirty and start with implementing our first SOAP service, we would try and

00:08.700 --> 00:12.550
understand the differences between REST and SOAP.

00:12.660 --> 00:19.510
Actually as we discussed earlier this is not apples to apples comparison because SOPA is an format of

00:19.680 --> 00:24.740
XML whereas REST is actually an architectural style.

00:24.780 --> 00:33.490
Let's talk about the data exchange format. In SOAP the data exchange format is always XML that too specifically

00:33.520 --> 00:40.080
the SOAP XML with SOAP envelope header and body. Both your request and response should adhere to the SOAP

00:40.110 --> 00:42.030
Structure. In REST

00:42.030 --> 00:45.820
there is no strict date exchange format.

00:45.960 --> 00:52.350
You can exchange a XML, a JSON or any other format you would want use.

00:52.470 --> 00:59.580
However, JSON is the most popular data exchange format in REST. As far as the service definitions are

00:59.580 --> 01:05.610
concerned SOAP uses WSDL. Web service definition language.

01:05.610 --> 01:09.800
REST does not have a standard definition language.

01:09.990 --> 01:17.760
While WADL is one of the standards. Web application definition language. However, its not really popularly

01:17.760 --> 01:19.500
Used. In this course,

01:19.560 --> 01:25.550
we are going to use one of the popular definitions for RESTful web services - Swagger.

01:25.710 --> 01:31.500
As far as the transport protocol is concerned SOAP does not pose any restrictions at all.

01:31.500 --> 01:36.870
You can use web that is HTTP or you can use MQ.

01:36.870 --> 01:45.180
REST is very specific about making the best use of HTTP protocol. RESTful services are typically

01:45.270 --> 01:49.020
more easier to implement than SOAP.

01:49.080 --> 01:55.470
RESTful services are typically based on JSON which is an easy format to pass and do things with it

01:55.950 --> 01:57.910
and also with RESTful services.

01:57.930 --> 02:05.670
we don't really need to mandate really define a service definition. But with SOAP you have to define WSDL and there

02:05.670 --> 02:11.580
are a lot of complexities associated with parsing your XMLs as well.

02:11.640 --> 02:17.880
These are some of the differences between REST and SOAP. This marks the end of our theory sessions on web services.

02:17.980 --> 02:19.310
Until the next video, bye-bye.
