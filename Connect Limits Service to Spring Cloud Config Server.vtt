00:03.850 --> 00:09.670
Welcome back in the previous step we connected the spring cloud config server to the GIT repository and

00:09.670 --> 00:11.840
also configure multiple.

00:11.860 --> 00:17.750
Environments conflagration from multiple environments of limits service in the GIT repository however.

00:18.280 --> 00:23.670
We have not really connected the limits service to pick the values from the spring cloud config server.

00:23.690 --> 00:26.680
In this step let's focus on doing that.

00:26.680 --> 00:34.420
What we'll do is we'll connect the limits service to pick up the configuration from the spring cloud config server

00:35.470 --> 00:41.870
all the configuration that we have been creating is in files which are named as application dot properties.

00:41.920 --> 00:44.060
This kind of the default.

00:44.170 --> 00:49.720
So if you're configuring anything related to the application then application dot properties is probably

00:49.720 --> 00:52.550
the default place where you would configure that.

00:52.780 --> 00:56.740
But now what we want to do is limit service configuration.

00:56.740 --> 01:03.130
We don't want it to be from application dot properties we would want it to connect to the spring cloud

01:03.130 --> 01:06.570
config server and pick it up.

01:06.580 --> 01:09.210
We don't know how to configure the values in here.

01:09.280 --> 01:15.940
What we want to do is we would want to limits service to talk to the spring cloud config server and pick up

01:15.940 --> 01:20.590
the configuration from there one of the important things is.

01:20.590 --> 01:27.700
If you would want to pick up the configuration from a spring cloud config server the property file

01:27.760 --> 01:29.760
has to be renamed.

01:29.770 --> 01:37.960
I should not use the name application dot properties but I would start calling this bootstrap dot properties.

01:38.200 --> 01:46.010
So instead of application dot properties the name is bootstrap dot properties so let's rename this to

01:46.010 --> 01:47.880
bootstrap dot properties.

01:47.890 --> 01:52.660
The other important thing is we don't really want to configure values in here because all the configuration

01:52.720 --> 01:57.000
of the values should happen on the spring cloud config server.

01:57.430 --> 02:03.760
Typically the things which would be present in Bootstrap properties are configuration of what is the

02:03.760 --> 02:05.370
name of the application.

02:05.530 --> 02:13.900
Then you need to tell limits service where this spring cloud config server is which URL can be used

02:13.900 --> 02:21.110
to talk to this spring cloud config server if I say Spring dot cloud dot config dot

02:21.250 --> 02:30.750
URI that's a property where you can store the value of the URI or the URL actually of this spring

02:31.340 --> 02:36.250
cloud config server port what did we use localhost 8888.

02:36.300 --> 02:41.930
That's the URI which we made use what I'll do is I'll restart the limits service.

02:41.950 --> 02:45.450
Let's see if this is running OK.

02:45.460 --> 02:46.820
I don't really have it running.

02:46.860 --> 02:51.790
Let's go ahead and now start up the limits service application.

02:51.790 --> 02:56.530
The important thing is the fact that the name of the application is a limites hyphen service.

02:56.810 --> 03:00.650
So we exactly match in the GIT local config repo.

03:00.740 --> 03:04.100
We have limites hyphen service hyphen dev hyphen QA.

03:04.180 --> 03:09.480
So this application name is a critical part of your bootstrap dot properties.

03:09.490 --> 03:15.230
Now based on this application name we are going to pick up values from the git local repository.

03:15.620 --> 03:19.340
Now the application has started up.

03:19.380 --> 03:27.290
If I search for localhost 8 8 8 8 you'd see that fetching config from server at so and so and

03:27.300 --> 03:34.200
you can see it says located environment name is equal to limites service and profile's is equal to default

03:34.590 --> 03:38.480
because we have not really configured a profile in here.

03:38.510 --> 03:40.690
It picks up the default profile.

03:40.800 --> 03:46.840
Later we'll see it we'll see how you can configure a profile and pick up the configuration for that.

03:46.890 --> 03:47.650
specific environment.

03:47.760 --> 03:52.590
But for now let's use the default profile so we're using the default profile and we are picking up the

03:52.590 --> 03:55.230
values from the default profile.

03:55.380 --> 04:01.080
So I would recommend you to spend some time looking at the log and seeing how the local host 8 8 

04:01.110 --> 04:06.370
8 8 is being use to pick up the values from the spring cloud config server.

04:06.480 --> 04:14.480
if you execute the URI local host 80 80 slash limits you would see maximum is 888 minimum is 8.

04:14.480 --> 04:16.170
Where did we configure that.

04:16.170 --> 04:22.730
That's coming from your limits service dot properties that's the default values that we have configured.

04:23.000 --> 04:30.120
So what we have done in this step is we connected the limites service to the spring cloud config server all that we

04:30.120 --> 04:37.370
had to do was to rename application dot properties to bootstrap dot properties and configure of the URI of this spring

04:37.380 --> 04:40.110
cloud config server by default.

04:40.140 --> 04:47.400
It's become picking up the values from limits hyphen service dot properties which is the default profile

04:47.750 --> 04:53.760
in the next step we would look at configuring profiles in the limits service and picking up the properties for

04:53.760 --> 04:54.800
the appropriate.

04:54.810 --> 04:56.030
Environment.

04:56.200 --> 04:57.230
Until then bye bye.
