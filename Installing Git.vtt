Welcome back.

00:04.420 --> 00:12.170
As discussed earlier spring cloud config server fix up the configuration from a git repository.

00:12.340 --> 00:17.260
We would want to connect our limit service to spring cloud config server.

00:17.260 --> 00:25.000
We have the limits services ready and we have spring cloud config server but we have not really connected them

00:25.000 --> 00:25.690
yet.

00:25.780 --> 00:31.590
Before we think about connecting them to git repository we need to install a local git.

00:31.920 --> 00:39.300
So what I'll do is go to Google and you can do a search for git it is the one of the most popular version

00:39.310 --> 00:45.000
control systems as you would already know all the code for this particular code is stored in git hub

00:45.300 --> 00:49.190
which is open source cloudbase installation of kit.

00:49.330 --> 00:54.700
What I will do is I'll go the first result set git hyphen scm dot com if you going there

00:55.390 --> 01:04.090
you can get a basic introduction to get what we would want to do is to install git in our local machine.

01:04.120 --> 01:08.980
So over here because I am on Mac I can see downloads for Mac.

01:09.070 --> 01:12.690
If you're not on Mac you would be seeing your specific downloading here.

01:12.700 --> 01:20.080
The other option is also to go to downloads and pick up the one for your specific operating system so

01:20.080 --> 01:23.440
if you're on Windows go to Windows Mac go to Mac.

01:23.440 --> 01:29.350
Download the exe for you a specific operating system and doubleclick on it to install it.

01:29.350 --> 01:33.640
The installation should be a very very simple process should be a cakewalk.

01:33.640 --> 01:38.960
Couple of clicks to the folder and install it and I see you in the next step.

01:39.040 --> 01:41.900
Once you have installed you are local git.

01:42.040 --> 01:42.860
Until then bye bye.
