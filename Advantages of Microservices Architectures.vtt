Welcome back in this video we would be discussing about some of the advantages of microServices.

00:09.500 --> 00:17.030
Architecture is the most important advantage of the MicroServices architecture is that it enables you

00:17.030 --> 00:22.820
to adapt new technology and processes very easy.

00:22.820 --> 00:30.890
When they build applications as a combination of microservices which can communicate with each other

00:31.190 --> 00:38.400
using simple messages each of these microservices can be built in different technologies.

00:38.570 --> 00:43.760
Typical more nolet applications people would not have that flexibility.

00:43.790 --> 00:50.810
For example Microservice one might be java MicroService two might be Nodejs Microservice three might be

00:50.810 --> 00:57.770
written in Kotlin and tomorrow there might be a language X Y Z which is really doing well and which

00:57.770 --> 01:05.390
provides a lot of benefits to you and you can easily create a micro service in that specific language.

01:05.600 --> 01:14.110
And also for the new Microservices that we create we can bring in new processors as well.

01:14.120 --> 01:21.800
The other important advantage of Microservices is Dynamic scaling consider an online shopping application

01:21.920 --> 01:23.260
like Amazon.

01:23.380 --> 01:30.470
They don't really have the same amount of load or same amount of traffic or same amount of users throughout

01:30.470 --> 01:33.690
the year especially during the holiday season.

01:33.710 --> 01:41.870
The load on the application will be a lot and during the rest of the year there might not be so much

01:42.110 --> 01:47.970
load during the Black Friday there might be a huge amount of load.

01:48.350 --> 01:56.450
If your microServices are cloud enabled they can scale dynamically and you can procure hardware and release

01:56.460 --> 01:59.090
that dynamically as well.

01:59.210 --> 02:06.770
So you can scale up your applications and scale them down based on the Loadd because you're developing

02:06.770 --> 02:08.620
smaller components.

02:08.870 --> 02:16.870
It's much easier to release micro services compared to monolith applications.

02:16.880 --> 02:26.550
This means that you can bring new features faster to market and that's a big advantage to have in the

02:26.550 --> 02:27.910
modern world.

02:27.990 --> 02:33.150
In this video we discuss about three of the most important advantages of Microservices

02:33.170 --> 02:42.960
its adoption of new technology and processes dynamic scaling and faster release cycles until the next video

02:42.960 --> 02:43.670
bye bye.

02:43.670 --> 02:44.010
Purée.
