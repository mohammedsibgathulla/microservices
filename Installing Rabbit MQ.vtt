Welcome back in this video we will learn how to install rabbitMq.

00:08.990 --> 00:14.860
Q If you go to the home page of the git repository for this code you'd see something called installing

00:14.890 --> 00:15.360
tools.

00:15.370 --> 00:21.130
So if you click the link you'd go to a section where you would see all the instructions that are needed

00:21.130 --> 00:28.540
to install all the tools for this specific course in the installing tool section you'll see a subsection

00:28.780 --> 00:31.420
for installing a rabbitMQ.

00:31.450 --> 00:38.170
before you install rabbitMQ one of the important things that you'd need to understand is you'd need

00:38.500 --> 00:44.310
Erlang So to be able to run rabbit MQ you'd need to install Erlang.

00:44.490 --> 00:50.370
You would first discuss the steps in installing rabitMQ On Windows before discussing the steps on

00:50.510 --> 00:51.340
a Mac.

00:51.370 --> 00:54.970
So let's get started with installing rabbitMQ on windows.

00:54.970 --> 01:00.140
You can take this link which is present in here rabbitMQ dot com install Windows dot html

01:00.490 --> 01:01.310
so if you.

01:01.420 --> 01:06.800
take that link you'd have exe links to install rabbitMQ.

01:06.910 --> 01:10.600
But before that you need to install Erlang.

01:10.660 --> 01:16.700
So once you go to this link you can see a link down here saying Erlang for Windows installer.

01:16.720 --> 01:22.940
If you open that in a new window you can get the latest installation for Erlang.

01:22.960 --> 01:28.480
So depending on whether you are on a 32 bit Windows or 64 bit Windows you can choose the appropriate

01:28.510 --> 01:32.890
binary file download it and install installing it should be a cakewalk.

01:32.890 --> 01:36.610
There is nothing very complex in installing Erlang as such.

01:36.760 --> 01:41.710
So just download the exe double click it and follow the steps which come up and you should be able

01:41.710 --> 01:48.500
to easily install Erlang on Windows and once you do that you can go back to the rabbit MQ page that will

01:48.500 --> 01:53.940
launch it up from here so this is the URL rabbitMQ install Windows that the page we launched up earlier.

01:54.220 --> 02:01.210
So you go there and you can download the installation for Windows systems you can either use this one

02:01.210 --> 02:01.830
or this one.

02:01.840 --> 02:04.990
This is the one from git hub and this from bin tray.

02:04.990 --> 02:11.930
You can use either of them and you can go ahead and install I mean the installation would be straightforward

02:11.950 --> 02:17.200
you just need to choose a folder and you'd be able to straightforwardly install rabbit MQ.

02:17.360 --> 02:25.300
Once you installed rabbit MQ and Erlang on windows you would see that rabbit MQ by default would be running

02:25.300 --> 02:27.390
as a background servies.

02:27.610 --> 02:32.090
And you can control the rabbit MQ service from the start menu.

02:32.200 --> 02:38.200
If you have any problems with the installation then you can watch this video which is linked in here.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.600
So in the windows section there is a video here.

02:40.780 --> 02:41.740
YouTube.com.

02:41.910 --> 02:43.990
Watch this specific video.

02:44.110 --> 02:48.850
If you have any problem with installing rabbit MQ on Windows.

02:49.150 --> 02:57.790
Now let's move on to installing rabbit MQ On Mac on Mac we recommend using home brew and that's the link

02:57.850 --> 03:01.200
which is provided in here before you install the server.

03:01.240 --> 03:06.760
Make sure that you have the latest version of Brew So you just need to use the command Brue update and

03:07.740 --> 03:13.580
after that you need to install the rabbit MQ by just executing this command brew install rabbit MQ.

03:13.780 --> 03:21.430
Once you install the  rabbit MQ server you can launch it up by slash usr slash local slash sbin slash rabbit MQ

03:21.430 --> 03:27.160
hyphen server that's the command you'll see on the screen right now so slash usr slash local slash

03:27.170 --> 03:32.050
sbin one of the things you can do is you can add this folder

03:32.140 --> 03:33.900
to your bash profile.

03:34.120 --> 03:40.810
You might want to add this folder to your bash profile as it is shown in here and then you can just

03:40.810 --> 03:45.040
use the command Rabbitt MQ hyphen and server to launch it up.

03:45.070 --> 03:51.460
I would take the option of slash usr slash local slash sbin slash rabbit mq server and launch it up.

03:51.520 --> 03:55.980
This would launch up the rabbit MQ server if you're on Mac OK.

03:56.020 --> 04:00.230
That's all there is to installing rabbit MQ.

04:00.250 --> 04:02.340
The important thing is the prerequisite.

04:02.350 --> 04:02.850
Erlang.

04:02.860 --> 04:06.210
So make sure that you install Erlang before you install rabbit MQ.

04:06.400 --> 04:08.770
If you are in Windows you would start with this link.

04:08.770 --> 04:11.310
If you are on Mac you would start with this link.

04:11.350 --> 04:17.710
Make sure that you have rabbit MQ installed and it's up and running as a service on Windows or by using

04:17.710 --> 04:21.920
the command that we show here on Mac in the next step.

04:21.940 --> 04:28.510
We would start using rabbit MQ to add functionality to our Micro servies until then bye bye.
