00:01.510 --> 00:09.400
In the previous step, we returned a hard coded string back. We mapped get requests to this URI, to this method

00:09.400 --> 00:15.820
which was returning a simple string. In this step, we would actually create an object for hello world

00:15.860 --> 00:20.430
bean and try to return that back and see what would happen.

00:20.770 --> 00:24.520
One of the things you need to understand is the fact that there is a lot of things that are happening in

00:24.520 --> 00:25.510
the background.

00:25.660 --> 00:31.210
We used spring boot to create the project through the spring boot starter projects. We’re using frameworks

00:31.240 --> 00:34.320
like spring, spring MVC and a lot of other things.

00:34.450 --> 00:38.580
So there is a lot of magic which is happening in the background. Before we get there,

00:38.650 --> 00:45.130
we would focus on getting another simple get request working. So I’d copy this method.

00:45.250 --> 00:46.380
There would be a compilation error.

00:46.590 --> 00:48.420
Let's not worry about it right now.

00:48.510 --> 00:56.470
What I want to do is to create a get mapping to Hello World and this time I would want to create a bean

00:56.800 --> 00:58.910
and return it back.

00:58.930 --> 01:04.990
So instead of creating a simple string, I would want to create a bean and return it back. The URI I would

01:04.990 --> 01:11.800
want a map is hello world bean. We would continue mapping the get mapping request. However, instead of returning a

01:11.800 --> 01:13.530
string we want to return a bean back.

01:13.540 --> 01:14.230
How do we do that?

01:14.230 --> 01:15.630
Let's quickly do that.

01:15.820 --> 01:21.750
So we want to do hello world bean and I’ll make the change in the method name.

01:21.780 --> 01:28.720
Now you would see that the entire thing compiles but instead of creating hello world, what I would want

01:28.720 --> 01:32.440
to do is to create a hello world bean.

01:32.620 --> 01:37.910
One more thing I want to do is to make sure that this method is returning a hello world bean. So instead of string,

01:37.990 --> 01:38.940
we want to return a

01:39.120 --> 01:41.590
hello world bean. Actually the hello world bean is

01:41.590 --> 01:42.510
not really there.

01:42.520 --> 01:49.080
So let's go ahead and create that first. How do I create it? Control one or command one and one and create class

01:49.140 --> 01:50.130
Hello world bean.

01:50.320 --> 01:51.750
Let's do that.

01:51.940 --> 01:53.130
Hello world bean.

01:53.350 --> 01:55.230
I’ll take the defaults and click finish.

01:55.270 --> 01:58.380
And I would want to create next.

01:58.450 --> 02:04.150
If you’d see the constructor which is present in here. So let's go ahead and do a control one and create

02:04.150 --> 02:05.800
constructor hello world.

02:06.130 --> 02:10.590
I’d want to create a hello world bean with a message.

02:10.630 --> 02:18.990
What I want to do is this dot message is equal to message. Now, I would get another compilation error.

02:19.180 --> 02:22.650
Now I press control one and I'm going to create a message in here.

02:22.660 --> 02:24.960
So we have a private field called message.

02:25.180 --> 02:25.390
We have a

02:25.390 --> 02:25.960
hello bean

02:25.960 --> 02:31.500
accepting that in the constructor and setting it to itself. Let’s  create a getter.

02:31.940 --> 02:35.510
Sorry, a setter quickly. So I’ll say select setters.

02:35.680 --> 02:36.340
OK.

02:36.460 --> 02:43.880
The easiest way to do that is right click source and you can go and select generate getters and setters.

02:43.990 --> 02:49.750
So I generated a setter and obviously I would also want to generate a toString.

02:49.750 --> 02:52.140
So let's generate a tostring as well.

02:52.370 --> 02:54.570
Right click source generate tostring.

02:54.970 --> 02:55.870
I'll say OK.

02:56.180 --> 02:59.040
So we are creating a very simple bean. Nothing complex in here.

02:59.050 --> 02:59.580
So we’re

02:59.620 --> 03:02.510
Just creating a simple bean. And now our

03:02.590 --> 03:05.430
Hellh world controller would compile fine.

03:05.680 --> 03:11.830
So what we have done until now is very simple, right? We have defined a simple hello world bean which accepts

03:11.830 --> 03:18.550
a message and we are actually returning it back in the controller method. Let’s start the application up.

03:18.550 --> 03:20.180
Let's go to URI.

03:20.230 --> 03:21.520
Hello world bean.

03:21.750 --> 03:25.460
You would see that there is an error.

03:25.630 --> 03:27.440
It was an unexpected error.

03:27.630 --> 03:30.760
No converter found for return value of type

03:30.820 --> 03:32.270
Hello world bean.

03:32.320 --> 03:38.730
This is one of the important things that you need to understand. Actually it is not really a easy error to debug.

03:38.830 --> 03:41.480
And that's the reason why I illustrated this first step.

03:41.620 --> 03:45.820
So this hello world bean does not have a getter.

03:46.150 --> 03:51.280
So if we don't create a getter then the automatic conversion will not work.

03:51.280 --> 03:53.100
So let's go out and create the getter.

03:53.150 --> 03:54.220
So right click source.

03:54.250 --> 04:00.900
generate getters and setters and select the getter for that.

04:01.030 --> 04:04.850
And now you’d see that the getter is present in here.

04:04.960 --> 04:07.020
Let's quickly restart the application.

04:07.180 --> 04:11.850
And now if you launch the hello world bean you would see a JSON message back.

04:11.860 --> 04:13.410
You'd see that message.

04:13.570 --> 04:14.880
Hello world.

04:14.890 --> 04:19.210
You can see that this message is adhering to a JSON structure.

04:19.250 --> 04:21.590
We're calling this get URI.

04:21.820 --> 04:26.430
And the hello world bean is being returned with the value Hello world.

04:26.710 --> 04:31.440
And if you look at the structure it's actually reflecting the structure in here.

04:31.450 --> 04:35.640
So it’s just returning message and hello world.

04:35.890 --> 04:38.030
The name of the field here is message.

04:38.050 --> 04:45.770
So that's exactly what is here and the text which is being sent to the message is being presented as its value.

04:45.820 --> 04:49.800
And this coming back as a JSON string.

04:49.840 --> 04:53.320
In this step, we added in one more simple method.

04:53.470 --> 04:58.150
However, this is returning a bean back. Earlier we returned a simple string back.

04:58.150 --> 05:04.350
Now we're returning a bean back and this bean is being automatically converted into JSON and returned

05:04.370 --> 05:07.910
back. The first two steps were really simple, right?

05:07.930 --> 05:14.030
We just created a couple of simple methods. In the next step, we will understand what's happening in the

05:14.030 --> 05:17.390
background of these two steps.

05:17.390 --> 05:20.480
How is the request being handled?

05:20.480 --> 05:26.980
Who is handling the request and also how is the hello world bean content getting translated to a JSON.

05:27.110 --> 05:29.820
We'll look at all that in the next step.
